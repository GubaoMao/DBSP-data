# DBSP-data: High-Fidelity Event Logs from Sensor Manufacturing

This repository contains the experimental dataset used for evaluating the **DBSP (Declarative Business Process Simulation)** method. The data is a high-fidelity event log captured from a real-world sensor manufacturing shop floor.

## 📌 Dataset Overview
- **Source**: A sensor manufacturing shop floor.
- **Type**: Business Process Event Log.
- **Format**: CSV (Comma-separated values).
- **Application**: Used to validate process simulation models, specifically focusing on control-flow, temporal, and resource constraints.

## 📂 File Description
- `high_fidelity_sensor_log.csv`: The main dataset containing transactional records of the manufacturing process.
